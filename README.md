# Separate Server/Client Example
In this example we use Flask as an API that returns data formatted in JSON instead of JINJA template files.

## Run it!
To see it in action, navigate to `/backend/flask_app` and run `flask run`.
Then open `index.html` in your browser.

### JavaScript
See `/javascript` folder for JavaScript code examples that will be useful in your Project 5.
You can also run these yourself from the Console tab in Chrome DevTools while running this example or Project 5.
